# Assignment 02
Description:
This assignment was designed to organize 5 full names by first or last name.



# Variables
            var fullNames = new List<string>(); // The (first and last) name of each entered person.
            string currentNameInput; // used for the current input name
            var sortChoice = ""; //Stores whether the user wants to sort by first or last name. 
            var reversedNames = new List<string>(); // This list holds the fullName list with last names first. 
            var incomplete = true;  //Runs the while loop until it is complete(!incomplete)
# Code
This program utilizes if, else, and while conditions. 
The while loop was written to stop errors from happening when a user enters their sort choice.
